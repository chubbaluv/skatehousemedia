## TO-DO List
Setup some quality of life stuff

## General Architecture

This archive site is powered by NextJS static builds. Build files are deployed to an S3 bucket via GitHub actions when PRs or changes are pushed to main.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
